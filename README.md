# Ondetemvacina: Interactive mapping crowdsource platform to help Brazil fighting COVID-19

![alt text](./images/otv-responsive.webp) 
<p>Free collaborative platform for brazilian citizens to search and share details about COVID vaccination places.

## Why?
</p>
<div style="padding:20px 0;"><img style="width:250px" src="./images/otv-banner3.webp" /></div>
<p>
The motivation to create the project stemmed from realizing the delay and restrictions in Brazil's vaccine procurement; when the country finally acquired the vaccines, it faced difficulties in centralizing information about the available vaccines and identifying which vaccination centers citizens could visit to get them.
</p>

## What?
<div style="padding:20px 0;"><img style="width:250px" src="./images/otv-banner4.webp" /></div>
<p>
In response to the confused situation and the unprecedented challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, our team took the initiative to develop a project that had a profound impact on the vaccination campaign in Brazil. Launched at a critical moment, our public utility service not only facilitated access to vital vaccination information for millions of Brazilians but also symbolized the power of technology applied for the common good.  
</p>

## How?
<p>
By integrating advanced technology and strategically utilizing open data provided by a government API, we created an interactive mapping platform that located over 26,000 public vaccination sites, spread over more than 5,500 cities in Brazil. In addition, there are about 15,000 "temporary vaccination posts" created by city halls, that are not included in the official published data (not present in the government data). The tool, updated daily, provided real-time information on vaccine availability, employing an innovative approach based on historical distribution and consumption data.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, we embraced the concept of crowdsourcing, allowing the public to actively contribute to the accuracy of the information. This community engagement not only improved the reliability of the data presented but also strengthened the sense of collective responsibility and solidarity among users.  
</p>

<p>In summary, Ondetemvacina can be defined as a One-stop-shop scalable web platform (PAAS), referred to as the vaccination "WAZE", tool with GPS and map to indicate vaccination centers nearby and inform about the current situation at the center such as long queues, type of vaccine, wait time, and
user recommendations.

### Architecture and Work Flow
Our team, 5 brazilians in love with technology and with Brazil, including a founder, a full-stack developer and API architecture, a DBA data integrator, an UX designer, and me as a front-end developer.   
Agile use, CI/CD continuous integration, and 250M records consumed daily from the government API.

## Results
<p>
Our work was recognized with a prestigious national award from the Brazilian Society of Health Informatics (SBIS), highlighting the importance and effectiveness of our solution in a challenging context. Finding the top result on Google for vaccines in Brazil, and with over one million users accessing the platform in 6 months, according to Google Analytics, we are proud to have made a significant difference in the national vaccination effort.  
</p>
We got the 1st place in the National Digital Projects Competition: Use of Technology in the Fight Against COVID-19 by SBIS
